# MicrobitTemperatureLogger
Small test project to get the BBC Microbit and Raspberry Pi communicating 

# Things to install 
The host code running on the Raspberry Pi requires the use of the pySerial library. Make sure you have it installed with: 

	sudo apt-get install python-serial 

or 

	sudo apt-get install python3-serial 

I also put together the Microbit code using Mu. You can get Mu using: 

	sudo apt-get install mu
